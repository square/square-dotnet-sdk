## Create Payment

Charges a payment source, for example, a card 
represented by customer's card on file or a card nonce. In addition 
to the payment source, the request must also include the 
amount to accept for the payment.

There are several optional parameters that you can include in the request. 
For example, tip money, whether to autocomplete the payment, or a reference ID
to correlate this payment with another system. 
For more information about these 
payment options, see [Take Payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments).

The `PAYMENTS_WRITE_ADDITIONAL_RECIPIENTS` OAuth permission is required
to enable application fees.

```csharp
CreatePaymentAsync(Models.CreatePaymentRequest body)
```

### Parameters

    .Build();

    CreatePaymentResponse result = await paymentsApi.CreatePaymentAsync(body);
}
catch (ApiException e){};
```

## Cancel Payment by Idempotency Key

Cancels (voids) a payment identified by the idempotency key that is specified in the request. 

Use this method when status of a CreatePayment request is unknown. 
For example, after you send a CreatePayment 
request a network error occurs and you don't get a response. In this case, you can direct 
Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same idempotency 
key that you provided in your CreatePayment request you want  to cancel. After cancelling the 
payment, you can submit your CreatePayment request again. 
Note that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken, the end 
point returns successfully.

```csharp
CancelPaymentByIdempotencyKeyAsync(Models.CancelPaymentByIdempotencyKeyRequest body)
```

### Parameters
