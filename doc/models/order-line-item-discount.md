# Order Line Item Discount

Represents a discount that applies to one or more line items in an
order.

Fixed-amount, order-scoped discounts are distributed across all non-zero line item totals.
The amount distributed to each line item is relative to the
amount contributed by the item to the order subtotal.

| `AmountMoney` | [`Models.Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer.

| `Metadata` | `IDictionary<string, string>` | Optional | Application-defined data attached to this discount. Metadata fields are intended<br>to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief<br>information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it<br>in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally<br>identifiable information or card details).<br><br>Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set<br>`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br><br>Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.<br><br>An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br><br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br><br>For more information, see [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata). |

| `PricingRuleId` | `string` | Optional | The object ID of a [pricing rule](../../doc/models/catalog-pricing-rule.md) to be applied<br>automatically to this discount. The specification and application of the discounts, to<br>which a `pricing_rule_id` is assigned, are completely controlled by the corresponding<br>pricing rule. |
