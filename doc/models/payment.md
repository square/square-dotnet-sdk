| `CustomerId` | `string` | Optional | The ID of the customer associated with the payment.

If a profile is not found, the<br>API attempts to create an<br>[instant profile](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does#instant-profiles).<br>If the API cannot create an<br>instant profile (either because the seller has disabled it or the<br>seller's region prevents creating it), this field remains unset. Note that<br>this process is asynchronous and it may take some time before a<br>customer ID is added to the payment.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `191` |
