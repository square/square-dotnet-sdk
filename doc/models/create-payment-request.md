| `ReferenceId` | `string` | Optional | A user-defined ID to associate with the payment.<br><br>You can use this field to associate the payment to an entity in an external system<br>(for example, you might specify an order ID that is generated by a third-party shopping cart).<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `40` |
