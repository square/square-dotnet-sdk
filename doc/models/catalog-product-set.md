# Catalog Product Set

Represents a collection of catalog objects for the purpose of applying a
`PricingRule`. Including a catalog object will include all of its subtypes.
For example, including a category in a product set will include all of its
items and associated item variations in the product set. Including an item in
a product set will also include its item variations.
